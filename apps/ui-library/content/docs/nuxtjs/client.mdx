## Installation

<BlockItem name="supabase-client-nuxtjs" description="Supabase Client for Nuxt.js" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="supabase-client-nuxtjs" />

## Usage

This block installs a Supabase client for connecting your Nuxt.js project to Supabase. It's designed to fully supports server-side rendering (SSR).

If you've already set up your Supabase client—either using the `npm create nuxt@latest` template or another method—you can continue using your existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&tab=frameworks&framework=vuejs&using=supabasejs) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API keys](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

- If you wish to have a great Developer Experience while using Supabase with Nuxt, try the official Nuxt [module](https://supabase.nuxtjs.org/).

<Callout type="warning" className="mt-4">
  {' '}
  This Supabase client is built for SSR with the Nuxt.js. If you're building a Vue SPA, use the [Vue
  SPA client](/ui/docs/vue/client) instead.{' '}
